The repository bundles multiple examples so you can validate both the frontend UX and the backend
plumbing without writing a line of glue code. Use them as references when integrating useVoice into
your own stack.

## React demo

- Location: `examples/react-demo`
- Commands:

  ```bash
  bun --filter @usevoice/example-react run dev
  ```

- Highlights:
  - Toggle between the mock websocket (`VITE_USEVOICE_USE_MOCK=1`) and a real backend (`VITE_USEVOICE_WS_URL`).
  - Displays `status.stage`, live transcripts, final transcripts, and realtime audio playback meters.
  - Shows how to consume `audioStream` and `useTtsPlayer` inside a component.

## Vue demo

- Location: `examples/vue-demo`
- Commands:

  ```bash
  bun --filter @usevoice/example-vue run dev
  ```

- Highlights:
  - Demonstrates the Vue composable API.
  - Uses the same `DemoWebSocket` mock so you can test UX flows offline.

## Cloudflare Worker

- Location: `examples/cloudflare-worker`
- Commands:

  ```bash
  cd examples/cloudflare-worker
  bun install
  bun run dev
  ```

- Highlights:
  - Wires `VoiceSessionManager` into a Durable Object via `createVoiceDurableObject`.
  - Provisions Deepgram + Cartesia providers using secrets (`wrangler secret put …`).
  - Handles `/voice-command/ws` websocket upgrades and exposes a `/health` route for monitoring.

## Docs app

- Location: `docs/`
- Commands:

  ```bash
  cd docs
  bun install
  bun run dev
  ```

- Highlights:
  - Built with FumaDocs + TanStack Start.
  - Pulls content from `docs/content/docs`.
  - Shares styles/components you can reuse in your own product documentation.

Feel free to clone any of these setups as a starting point. They intentionally share the exact code
paths your production app will exercise, so any improvements you make here directly benefit real
users.
