useVoice is a multi-runtime voice AI SDK that pairs a realtime speech interface on the client with
pluggable transcription, agent, and text-to-speech providers on the backend. The monorepo is managed
with Bun workspaces so every package shares tooling and typechecking.

## What useVoice gives you

- **Realtime streaming transcripts** sourced from Deepgram (or any `TranscriptionProvider`) and
  forwarded as `transcript.partial` websocket events the moment STT returns an interim result.
- **Incremental audio playback** over the same socket: the server emits raw PCM chunks between
  `tts.start`/`tts.end`, and the React hook exposes an async iterable you can render or pipe into
  the provided TTS player.
- **Agent orchestration** via the `VoiceSessionManager`: once a transcript finalizes, it invokes
  your `AgentProcessor` (mock or production) and forwards the structured response back to the client.
- **Framework adapters** for React, Vue, Cloudflare Durable Objects, and mocked sockets so you can
  test both UX and backend flows locally.

## Workspace layout

| Package / Example            | Purpose |
| ---------------------------- | ------- |
| `@usevoice/core`              | Recorder + socket controller, async audio streams, and shared state store. |
| `@usevoice/react` / `@usevoice/vue` | Framework bindings that expose `useVoiceCommand` plus React-only helpers like `useTtsPlayer`. |
| `@usevoice/server`            | `VoiceSessionManager`, node/Durable Object adapters, and provider contracts. |
| `@usevoice/deepgram` / `@usevoice/cartesia` | Production provider implementations for Deepgram STT and Cartesia TTS. |
| `examples/react-demo` / `examples/vue-demo` | Frontend playgrounds that can run against the mock socket or your Cloudflare Worker. |
| `examples/cloudflare-worker` | Durable Object backend that wires Deepgram + Cartesia into the session manager. |
